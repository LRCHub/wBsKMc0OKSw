My baby like to string me on
좀 더 내게 다가와
네게 맞춰 온 my bass
살짝 너의 맘을 slide
그냥 놓치긴 아쉬워 난
넌 어떻게 생각해?
자 follow me now
이 리듬이 다시 make me spin
We makin' music (makin' music)
Everyday we play 가볍게 groovin' (가볍게 groovin')
느낀 대로 해 don't stop the music (don't stop the music)
Hands up on my bass
지금부터 lower, lower, lower
We want that
Boom-ba-doom, boom, boom, bass

We got that boom-ba-doom, on my bass
(Boom-ba-doom, on my bass)
우린 좀 더 lower, lower, lower
We want that
박자에 맞춰 up, down 줄을 감싸
밀고 당겨 doom slap, let's countdown
음은 자꾸만 flat 괜찮아, 뭐 어때?
우리 사이 keep going make a bass line (hoo)
너도 왠지 템포가 빨라 (빨라)
따라와 둘만의 timeline (timeline)
Hands in the sky, yeah
You know what I like (like)
